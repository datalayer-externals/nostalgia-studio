# CRDT examples from a DWEB talk
- https://dwebcamp2022.sched.com/event/197CF/crdts-go-brrr-lets-make-all-our-systems-collaborative

- This session will be a practical talk for programmers explaining what CRDTs are and how they work.
  - CRDTs (Concurrent Replicated Data Types) are cool data structures which allow almost any data to be collaboratively edited in a distributed way. 
  - I'll explain what they are, and we'll build up a simple real-time distributed database with collaborative editing on top of CRDTs, live before your eyes.
