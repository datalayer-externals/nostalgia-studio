# Full editor

This is supposed to be the final result of this project with all the necessary boilerplate derived from the `atlassian` editor but re-implemented in my own way.

## How to install

This project uses Yarn workspaces so you don't really have to install anything. By running `yarn` in the root folder all the dependencies should be installed automatically.

## Commands

- `yarn watch` starts the Rollup compiler and watches changes to the editor
- `yarn build` compiles the code as both CommonJS and ES module.
